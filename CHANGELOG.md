# Changelog — melchizedek-agents (the npm package)

Consumers of the package read this file; it records changes to the
**published API surface** (the exports map in `package.json`, the two
bins, and the starter pack), not the repo's full history.

## 0.9.6 — 2026-09-02

- **`web_extract` joins the public tool registry.** The tool's source
  (`lib/tools/webExtractTool.ts`) has shipped in the package since
  2026-08-09, but the sanitized `lib/toolRegistry.ts` never mapped the
  YAML name, so `augustin.yaml`'s two researchers logged an unknown-tool
  warning and ruled from search snippets. Declaring `web_extract` in a
  syndicate now resolves to the client-side page reader on every
  provider, local Ollama included. Additive: no export, bin, or starter
  file changes shape.

## 0.9.5 — 2026-09-02

- **The default production Gemini is now `gemini-3.8-flash`.** Two
  exported constants change VALUE (not shape): `MEMORY_EXTRACTION_MODEL`
  and `WIKI_AGENT_MODEL` in `lib/config.ts`, plus the internal
  `VISION_MODEL` behind `inspect_image`. Every starter-pack syndicate
  that shipped on `gemini-3.7-flash` now ships on `gemini-3.8-flash`.
  The cheap tier is untouched: `DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL` stays
  `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, and `ares` / `model_zoo` keep their flash-lite
  pins. Nothing in the exports map or the two bins changes.

  The id was verified against the live endpoint before pinning:
  `models/gemini-3.8-flash` publishes exactly 3.7's envelope —
  1,048,576 input, 65,536 output, `thinking: true`, identical
  `supportedGenerationMethods` — so no `maxOutputTokens` in any shipped
  YAML changes and none is an over-ask.

  If you pin a model explicitly in your own YAML, nothing changes for
  you. If you rely on the defaults and want the old behaviour, set
  `WIKI_AGENT_MODEL=gemini-3.7-flash` (env) or pin `model:` in your
  syndicate.

## 0.9.4 — 2026-09-02

- **Thinking and replies stream live.** The OpenAI-compatible adapter
  (Ollama, xAI) now honours ADK's `stream` flag instead of ignoring it:
  it sends `stream: true`, parses the SSE frames, and yields each
  reasoning and text delta as a display-only partial. `melchizedek-chat`
  runs with `streamingMode: SSE`, so a local qwen3 turn shows its
  scratchpad token by token from ~1.5s rather than dumping the whole
  turn after ~15s. `CHAT_STREAMING=false` restores one-block output —
  useful when piping a transcript or for structured-output agents.
  Reasoning is read from a discrete `reasoning` / `reasoning_content`
  delta field where the provider sends one (Ollama does), and otherwise
  from inline `<think>` tags via a new exported `ThinkStreamSplitter`,
  which tracks block state across frames so a tag split mid-delta
  ("<thi" + "nk>") is not mistaken for reply text.
- **Fix: a streamed Claude turn no longer vanishes from session
  history.** ADK's runner persists only NON-partial events, and the
  Claude streaming path built its final response with the text omitted,
  so a reply would render on screen and leave no record — the next turn
  saw no assistant message. The final response now carries the full
  text; printers skip text on a `turnComplete` event whose partials they
  already rendered. This path was unreachable before this release, since
  nothing requested SSE.
- **Chat is silent about telemetry.** `melchizedek-chat` and every
  `syndicate:*` script no longer print `[OTEL_SPAN_JSON]` lines; set
  `OTEL_CONSOLE_SPANS=true` (shell or `.env`) to see them, and
  `OTEL_CONSOLE_SPANS=false` to silence them in other scripts. In-process
  span listeners and the Supabase sink are unaffected either way, so no
  telemetry is lost.

## 0.9.3 — 2026-08-22

- **`outputSchema` is enforced on every provider, not just Gemini** —
  the Claude adapter now carries an agent's `outputSchema` as a forced
  tool call (`tool_choice` on a synthetic `structured_output` tool whose
  `input_schema` is the schema) and turns the validated `tool_use` block
  back into JSON text, so the keys arrive as declared instead of drifting
  (`"grade"` for `"correctness"`); the OpenAI adapter sends
  `json_schema` with `strict: true` over a schema where every object
  forbids extra properties and requires all of its own
  (`toStrictJsonSchema`), which the API previously rejected; the
  OpenAI-compatible adapter (xAI) does the same, while Ollama keeps
  `json_object`. Anything that reads structured fields by name — critic
  loops, plan-dispatch routers on non-Gemini models, LLM judges — now
  works across providers.
- **Engine additions behind the A2A server**: the shared YAML→ADK compiler
  (`lib/compile.ts`), provenance stamps (`lib/observability/lineage.ts`),
  embeddings (`lib/observability/embeddings.ts`), the three-tier
  observability ledger in `db/telemetry.sql` with identity and
  provenance on every span, and `scripts/telemetry_admin.ts`. New
  optional dependency `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` for
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.

## 0.9.2 — 2026-08-20

- **The starter pack gains Augustin** —
  `config/agents/examples/augustin.yaml`, a fact-checking arbiter of
  world events: a grok X-sweep researcher and a Gemini web-verification
  researcher under a tool-free Arbiter that writes a conversational
  lead plus sourced bullet facts. Multi-provider (needs `XAI_API_KEY`
  and `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`); `npm run syndicate:augustin` in a clone.
  The pattern is taught as a standalone lesson in the curriculum.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-08-19

- **Fix: `melchizedek-serve` actually starts.** The run-as-main guard
  compared `import.meta.url` to argv[1] literally; through the npm bin
  symlink they never match, so the 0.9.0 bin imported everything and
  exited silently. The guard now realpaths argv[1]. `melchizedek-chat`
  was unaffected.
- `melchizedek-serve` without an argument now explains itself when no
  `syndicate.yaml` exists (name your syndicate: `melchizedek-serve
  <name>.yaml`) instead of failing with a bare ENOENT.
- QUICKSTART gains §7, the package-consumer path (docs ship in the
  tarball, so they ride this release).

## 0.9.0 — 2026-08-19

First packaged release (pre-1.0: the API may still move; 1.0.0 lands
after the first external consumer migration).

- The engine is installable: `npm install melchizedek-agents` ships
  compiled JS + type declarations for `lib/` (`loadSyndicate`, the model
  registry, the tool registry, memory/session/persistence/observability,
  the wiki engine) behind an explicit subpath exports map.
- `loadSyndicate` accepts `agentsDir` (or the `MELCHIZEDEK_AGENTS_DIR`
  env var) so your syndicates live in **your** repo; default remains
  `<cwd>/config/agents`. The path jail applies relative to whichever
  root is configured.
- Two bins: `melchizedek-serve` (the A2A server) and `melchizedek-chat`
  (the interactive syndicate CLI).
- The starter pack ships in the package: `config/agents/examples/*.yaml`
  plus `syndicateSchema.yaml` — copy them out, they are teaching
  material, not wiring.
- `@google/adk` is a peer dependency: your app owns the ADK version.
